# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Vercel Setup Required

## Your Code is Deployed, But Authentication Won't Work Yet!

I've fixed the login and register pages to use the real API, but you need to complete the Vercel setup for authentication to work.

---

## What's Missing:

Your Vercel deployment is missing:
1. ❌ **Postgres Database** - Not created yet
2. ❌ **Environment Variables** - Not configured
3. ❌ **Database Migrations** - Not run

---

## Quick Fix (5 Minutes):

### Step 1: Create Vercel Postgres Database

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Storage** tab
3. Click **Create Database**
4. Select **Postgres**
5. Name it `game-forge-db`
6. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables

After creating the database:

1. Go to database → **`.env.local`** tab
2. Copy all `POSTGRES_*` variables
3. Go to your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add each `POSTGRES_*` variable (paste the values from database)

**Also add these:**

```bash
# Generate this with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<your-generated-secret>

# Your Vercel deployment URL
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **...** on latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

After redeployment succeeds:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Link your project
vercel link

# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.local

# Run migrations
npm run migrate:up
```

## Test Authentication:

After completing the above steps:

1. Go to your Vercel URL
2. Click **Register**
3. Fill in the form
4. You should be redirected to login (no more mock message!)
5. Login with your credentials
6. You'll be redirected to Main Anvil dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting:

### Still seeing "mock implementation"?
- ✅ Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- ✅ Check that you redeployed after adding environment variables
- ✅ Verify all POSTGRES_* variables are set in Vercel

### "Database connection failed"?
- ✅ Verify POSTGRES_URL is correct
- ✅ Check database is active in Vercel Storage
- ✅ Ensure database and project are in same region

### "Invalid credentials" on login?
- ✅ Make sure you registered first
- ✅ Check that migrations ran successfully
- ✅ Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set

---

## What I Fixed:

✅ Connected login page to `/api/auth/login`  
✅ Connected register page to `/api/auth/register`  
✅ Added proper error handling  
✅ Added redirect after successful auth  
✅ Removed mock implementation alerts  

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Complete the setup above** (5 minutes)
2. **Test registration and login**
3. **Enjoy your fully functional app!** 🎉
