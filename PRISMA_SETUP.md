# ✅ Prisma Setup Complete!

I've migrated your app to use **Prisma ORM** which works perfectly with your Prisma Accelerate database!

## What Changed:

✅ **Installed Prisma** - `@prisma/client` and `prisma`  
✅ **Created Prisma Schema** - Defined User model  
✅ **Updated Register API** - Now uses Prisma instead of raw SQL  
✅ **Updated Setup API** - Runs Prisma migrations  
✅ **Added Build Scripts** - Auto-generates Prisma client

## How to Set Up Database (2 Steps):

### Step 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment

Vercel is deploying your changes now (2-3 minutes). Check your Vercel dashboard.

### Step 2: Visit Setup URL

Once deployed, go to:

```
https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/setup-database
```

This will:
- Run `prisma db push`
- Create the `users` table
- Set up all indexes

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database setup complete! All tables created successfully."
}
```

## Test Registration:

After setup:

1. Go to your app
2. Click **Register**
3. Fill in the form:
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Domain: Select any
4. Submit
5. **It should work!** ✅
6. You'll be redirected to login
7. Login with your credentials
8. Success! 🎉

## Why Prisma is Better:

✅ **Type-safe** - Auto-completion and type checking  
✅ **Works with Prisma Accelerate** - Your database type  
✅ **Easier migrations** - Simple schema management  
✅ **Better DX** - Cleaner, more maintainable code  
✅ **Auto-generated client** - No manual SQL  

---

## Prisma Commands:

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client (auto-runs on build)
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npx prisma studio

# Create a migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

---

## What's Next:

1. **Wait for deployment** ⏳
2. **Visit `/api/setup-database`** 🔧
3. **Test registration** ✅
4. **Enjoy your working app!** 🎉

---

## Troubleshooting:

### Setup API returns error?
- Check Vercel logs
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set in environment variables
- Make sure deployment finished successfully

### Registration still fails?
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify setup API returned success

### Need to reset database?
- Visit `/api/setup-database` again (safe to run multiple times)
